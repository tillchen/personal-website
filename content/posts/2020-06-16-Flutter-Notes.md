## Introduction

This post is assuming that the reader has Android development background.

## Declarative UI

### Why

1. Flutter lets the developer describe the current UI state and leaves the transitioning to the framework. This lightens the burden on developers from having to program how to transition between various UI states.

### How

1. Example:

    ![Declarative UI](/images/declarativeUIchanges.png)

    ```java
    // Imperative style
    b.setColor(red)
    b.clearChildren()
    ViewC c3 = new ViewC(...)
    b.add(c3)
    ```

    ```dart
    // Declarative style
    return ViewB(
        color: red,
        child: ViewC(...)
    )
    ```

2. In the declarative style, view configurations (such as Flutter's Widgets) are immutable and only lightweight blueprints. To change the UI, a widget triggers a rebuild on itself and constructs a new Widget subtree. The framework manages many of the responsibilities behind the scenes.
